This is an **example** API to demonstrate features of the OpenAPI specification.

# Introduction

This API definition is intended to be a good starting point for
describing your API in

[OpenAPI/Swagger
format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md).

It also demonstrates features of the
[create-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Redocly/create-openapi-repo) tool
and

the [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc) documentation engine. Beyond
the standard OpenAPI syntax, we use a few

[vendor
extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).


# How we got started

We played and fudged. That didn't work.

Then we read the manual and landed up with this.

The moral of the story: RTFM

The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard,
language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which

allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities
of the service without access to source

code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly
defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can

understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of
implementation logic. Similar to what

interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the
guesswork in calling the service.
